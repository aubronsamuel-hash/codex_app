Root cause: roadmap_guard failed because 'Ref: docs/roadmap/step-XX.md' was missing. I learned that the guard parses both the PR body and the latest commit message, so skipping the reference string guarantees a failure even when tests are green. Prevention: always include 'Ref:' in PR body and in the last commit message. I'll keep the templates and CI checks aligned so the reference requirement stays visible to anyone preparing a commit or PR.
