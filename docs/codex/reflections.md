Adding the settings layer early helped keep the new diagnostics endpoints simple because the handlers can rely on shared state instead of hard-coded strings. Running the editable install after the first pytest failure reaffirmed that our coverage settings depend on the plugin being present; documenting that requirement in README avoided future confusion. I double-checked the auto-review checklist to ensure logging, documentation, and tests covered every touched file.
