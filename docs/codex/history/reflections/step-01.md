Root cause: Codex snapshots only tracked the latest reflection, TODO list, and last output, so each new step risked erasing earlier context. Action: I refreshed the snapshot files for this step, archived them into the append-only history folders, and added guardrails in the PR template and checklist to keep the archival ritual visible. Prevention: Always run the archive helper after updating the step summary, append new decisions instead of rewriting memory, and treat history files as immutable once written so future investigations have a trustworthy timeline.
