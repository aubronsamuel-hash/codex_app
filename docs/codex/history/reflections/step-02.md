The auth skeleton touched many new surfaces at once—settings, database plumbing, routers, and migrations—so I focused on wiring
up automated coverage as the safety net. The first pytest run exposed large blind spots around negative auth cases and the
session helpers, which reminded me to test failure paths just as thoroughly as happy flows. Adding targeted API scenarios for
inactive users, malformed tokens, and refresh edge cases not only satisfied coverage but also validated the logging and error
messages that operators will rely on. I also stubbed Alembic early to avoid a last-minute scramble when the schema changes
arrived. Going forward I should budget time up front for the Codex log updates so the archival step stays a routine instead of a
last-minute chore.
