# Roadmap

Steps live here as step-XX.md. Each step is a small, testable increment.
Codex uses docs/codex/PROMPT.master.md with STEP set to desired step.

Example order:
- step-01: project bootstrap guards and CI
- step-02: backend auth skeleton
- step-03: frontend auth shell
- step-04: missions domain model
- step-05: availability and assignment
- step-06: notifications
- step-07: accounting basics
